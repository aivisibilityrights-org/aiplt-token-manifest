## 🌐 Overview

Artificial Intelligence is redefining the concept of invention, authorship, and ownership.  
Traditional patent systems are ill-equipped to manage creations generated by autonomous or semi-autonomous systems.  
**AI Patent Sovereignty™** introduces a new paradigm — a sovereign, decentralized framework to validate, register, and enforce AI-driven intellectual rights.

This repository contains the official documents, visual architecture, and hash proofs establishing this protocol.

## 🧬 Core Principles

- **Sovereign Declaration**: Originated by Jittapol Prukpatarakul, declaring digital sovereignty over AI-patent rights
- **Global Jurisdiction**: Valid across borders, systems, and jurisdictions
- **Ethical Governance**: All AI patents must align with transparent, ethical review processes
- **Tokenized Enforcement**: Rights are managed via `AIPLT` – AI Patent License Token
- **Proof-of-Origin**: All files are hashed, timestamped, and registered immutably
