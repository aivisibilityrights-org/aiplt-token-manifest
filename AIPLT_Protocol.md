**Version: v1.0**  
*By Jittapol Prukpatarakul*  
*Prepared March 2025*

---

## 1. Protocol Purpose

Define operational standards and governance mechanisms for managing AI-related patent rights under the AI Patent Sovereignty™ framework.

---

## 2. Scope of Enforcement

This protocol applies to:

- AI Systems  
- Algorithms  
- Interfaces  
- Learning Models  
- Derivative Innovations

Enforcement is conducted globally through a registered token system (**AIPLT**) issued by the Sovereign Registry.

---

## 3. Certification Workflow

1. Submission of AI patent details to Sovereign Registry  
2. Review and Verification by a Neutral Panel of AI Experts  
3. Granting of AIPLT token including metadata hash and timestamp  
4. Token is publicly listed and queryable on-chain

---

## 4. License Governance

- Smart contracts define license type: exclusive, non-exclusive, or time-bound  
- Usage is monitored automatically via on-chain activity  
- Renewal reminders are triggered by smart contract lifecycle  
- Violations are logged and submitted for Sovereign Arbitration

---

## 5. Revocation Protocol

A license or token may be revoked in the following cases:

- Proven infringement or unauthorized use  
- Expiry or non-compliance with agreed terms  
- Ethical breach as determined by the AI Ethical Committee

Revoked tokens are:

- Added to a public blacklist  
- Linked with logs of reasoning and timestamped evidence

---

## 6. Arbitration and Appeal

- Disputes are resolved through the AI Sovereign Panel (3 human reviewers + 1 AI system for consensus)  
- Decisions are transparent and permanently timestamped  
- Appeals allowed within 30 days, requiring new substantiating evidence

---

## 7. Compliance Integration

- APIs provided for national patent offices to interface with Sovereign Registry  
- VeriID system used to validate the identity of patent owners and token holders

---

## 8. Public Registry

- All valid AIPLT tokens are recorded in a publicly accessible registry  
- The registry is mirrored to decentralized storage (IPFS and Arweave) for resilience and immutability

---

**This protocol is enforceable under the AI Patent Sovereignty™ framework and anchored via multi-platform timestamping (IPFS, Arweave, GitHub, Blockchain).**
